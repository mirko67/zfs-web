      <question> <para>zpool create fails with "dir is not
      empty"</para>
      </question>
      <answer><para>The mount point specified is not empty. Make sure
      that the mount point does not contain any files or directories for
      the newly created pool to be mounted. If the mountpoint has any
      files created the mount will fail. This is possible if
      inadvertantly files were created before filesystem was mounted, at
      a later point if you issue "zfs mount -a" the command will
      fail.</para>
