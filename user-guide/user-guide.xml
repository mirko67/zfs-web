          <answer>
            <para>Under certain conditions zfs rollback might panic
    the system. Please backup your data before attempting this and we
    recommend that you reboot the machine and run zpool scrub should
    this occur.. </para>

          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>Although the pool layout in this port is exactly the
    same as that on opensolaris there are subtle differences. Firstly
    ACLs are not supported and fuids are never populated in
    linux. Please contact us before you attempt to import a filesystem
    from solaris to linux. Secondly the extended attributes in linux
    are implemented by prefixing the attribute name with the attribute
    class. e.g. &quot;user.&quot; for user attributes &quot;security.&quot; for selinux
    security attributes. This imposes the restrition that any
    arbitrary named attribute will not exist on linux, it will have a
    prefix either &quot;user&quot; or &quot;security&quot;. While the attributes in
    opensolaris can have any arbitrary name.

          <question>
            <para>zfs share does not work</para>
          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>zfs share command does not export the filesystem marked
      with sharenfs=on. The exporting is done at the time zfs set
      sharenfs=on tank is executed. Since this internally invokes the
      exportfs command the effects are equivalent if you chose to use
      exportfs instead of zfs sharenfs=on to export. This current
      limitation of &quot;zfs share&quot; not invoking exportfs will be fixed in
      a minor patch release.</para>

            <para>How do I set nfs options while exporting</para>
          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>Currently the nfs integration within the zfs command is
      limited to invoking exportfs. It does not give control to set
      the various options like &quot;no_root_squash&quot; or other exportfs
      options. If such fine grained control over the nfs export is
      required we recommend that you use exportfs directly.</para>

    correctly on client</para>
          </question>
          <answer>
            <para>Depending on your setup the nfs exports might happen
    before the zfs filesystems are mounted. This would result in
    mountpoints for the ZFS filesystems being exported
    instead. Unexport and re-export the /etc/fstab entries</para>

      <title>Download The Binaries</title>
      <para>To download &KQS; please visit our website <ulink url="http://www.kqstor.com/">http://www.kqstor.com/</ulink> and
download the tar.gz file appropriate for your distribution and kernel
version. The direct link to download is <ulink url="http://www.kqstor.com/download">here</ulink>. The name of the tar.gz file
indicates the Distribution, the distro version and the kernel version
for which these files are built. For example consider file
&quot;Deb_Package_Ubuntu10.4_2.6.32-25-server.tar.gz&quot; or
&quot;zfs-fedora-2.6.35.6-48.fc14.x86_64.tar.gz&quot;. The former is for Ubuntu
10.04 running kernel 2.6.32-35 while the later is for Fedore 14
running linux kernel 2.6.35.6-48.</para>
      <para> The tar.gz provided contains native packages for your
distribution built against the supported kernel. These packages might
have dependencies on other packages part of the distribution which
might not be installed on your machine. You would need to respond to
the error messages during installation appropriately and install the
pre-requisites as required.
