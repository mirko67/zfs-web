<para>
  The ZFS on linux functionality is provided by three modules which
  are maintained in seperate source trees. These are 
  <simplelist>
    <member>spl (solaris porting layer)</member>
    <member>zfs (core dmu/dsl functionality)</member>
    <member>lzfs (linux posix layer)</member>
  </simplelist>
  You need to retrive the sources for all three and compile them. If
  any one of them are missing zfs won't function. The three
  repositories can be accessed at the following url <ulink
  url="https://github.com/zfs-linux">https://github.com/zfs-linux</ulink>
</para>

<para>
  The commands and procedures required to build freash modules from
  source are listed below. Please note that some of the tools used in
  the procedure might not be installed on your machine and the error
  that result don't always clearly indicate that the package was
  missing.
